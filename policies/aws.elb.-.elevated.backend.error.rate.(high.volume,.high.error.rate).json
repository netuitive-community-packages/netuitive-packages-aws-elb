In this case, we are looking for both high traffic volumes (> 1000) as well as error rates that are not just higher than normal, but are above the 2% threshold. In those cases, a Critical event will be generated. You may wish to tune either the 1,000 request count threshold, the 2% error threshold, or both, to better suit your environment.",
