    "description": "This is another error rate policy, but rather than looking at backend error rates, it is looking at errors from the ELB itself.  In this case, we look for both high traffic volumes (> 1000) as well as error rates that are not just higher than normal, but are above a 2% threshold. In those cases, a Critical event will be generated. You may wish to tune either the 1,000 request count threshold, the 2% error threshold, or both, to better suit your environment.",
